CDR FAQ

Q.
 CDR vs SMDR. What the difference?

A.
 SMDR is centered on the station, while CDR is centered on the call.
 That is why they are called what they're called.
 SMDR, generally, is produced in real time while cdr, generally,
 is produced upon completion of a call. Most SMDR consumers are real
 time applications such as CRM, operator console, other applications
 that act on information while a call is still in progress;
 most CDR consumers are reporting applications such as LD billing,
 hospitality PMS, traffic studies.

 Regardless of their size, most telephone systems output
 Call Detail Records (CDR). Generally, these are created at the end of
 a call. But on some phone systems, the data is available during the call.
 This data is output from the phone system by a serial link known as
 the Station Message Detail Recording port (SMDR).
